# Django URL Objects = URLjects - This project is no longer maintained

Since Django 2.0 introduced new system of routing I dont think kind of approach is desired anymore.

Library which greatly simplifies django urls definition! And as a side effect it makes translated urls amazingly easy. Just compare

```python
# old urls notation
url('^detail/(?<slug>[\w-]+)', MyDetailView.as_view(), name='detail')
# easified !even translated! notation
url(U / _('detail') / slug, MyDetailView, name='detail')
```

## Getting rid of ``urls.py``

With the use of ``include_view()`` you can avoid ``urls.py`` and include
your app's views directly in root ``urls.py``.

```python
    from urljects import view_include
    # inside your root urls.py
    urlpatterns = [
        # old style
        url("myapp/", include("myapp.urls")),
        # new urljects style
        url("myapp/", view_include("myapp.views"))
    ]
```

#### Soo how to put urls directly into views?

I am glad you asked! For class based views simply inherit from ``URLView`` and add
``name`` and ``url`` as their attributes.

```python
from urljects import URLView, U, slug
from django.views.generic import DetailView

class ItemDetail(URLView, DetailView):
    name = 'detail'
    url = U / 'detail' / slug
```

A lot of people enjoy functional views, for those there is ``url_view`` decorator.

```python
from urljects import url_view

@url_view(U / 'category' / rest)
def detail(request, rest)
    ...
```

After that you can user ``view_include`` instead of creating ``urls.py`` and
then old-style ``include`` them afterwards.


## I want to keep my urls.py

Quite often you need some ``urls.py`` - for example your root urls. Then you can
use patterns like ``slug`` or ``rest`` as shown above inside your ``urls.py``.
We even provide modified ``url`` function to strip away the boilerplate of
``.as_view()``,

```python
from urljects import U, slug, url

url_patterns = (
    url(U / 'detail' / slug, view=DetailView),
    # instead of
    url(r'^detail/(?P<slug>[\w-]+)' , view=DetailView.as_view(),
        name='detail'),
)
```

The name of the view has been taken from ``DetailView.url_name``.
There are also some common regular patterns like slugs and UUIDs so that you
can focus on more important stuff than on debugging regular expressions.
